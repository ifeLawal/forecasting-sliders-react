I want to inform you that whenever you use the app, in a case of an error in the app, I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data.

This app does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, we would be really sad.


Security
This app will not be collecting any Personal Information, that being said I will still try to have the app be secure through latest application code and guides.


Children’s Privacy
